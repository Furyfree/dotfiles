# Dream Browser Summary

- **Core philosophy** → lean and fast like **Helium**, built by patching Chromium instead of reinventing it.
- **UX** → clean and polished like **Zen**, minimal chrome (UI), everything shaved down.
- **Search bar** → behaves like **Gecko**: **customizable to your own liking**, e.g. only searches bookmarks + open tabs, falls back to the web if nothing matches. No history, no AI/ML clutter unless you enable it.
- **Tabs** → simple horizontal tabs by default, but **optional vertical tabs** for research-heavy use.
- **Tidy** → manual button to group tabs (like Arc), not auto rules.
- **AI** → invisible until invoked. On-demand sidebar that can:
  - Summarize the current page (with scrolling + dynamic content).
  - Correlate across multiple tabs (“these 3 are the same story, here’s the overlap”).
  - Help clean up duplicates or merge research.

**End result**: a **minimal, user-controlled browser** with optional power features.
No bloat, no in-your-face AI — just speed, clarity, and tidy tools.
